# What is Mono?

Mono, the open source development platform based on the .NET framework, allows developers to build cross-platform applications with improved developer productivity. Monoâ€™s .NET implementation is based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Infrastructure.

Sponsored previously by Novell and now by Xamarin, the Mono project has an active and enthusiastic contributing community. Mono includes both developer tools and the infrastructure needed to run .NET client and server applications.

# How to use this image

## Compile your app inside the Docker container

There may be occasions where it is not appropriate to run your app inside a container. To compile, but not run your app inside the Docker instance, you can write something like:

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp jamesottaway/mono:latest xbuild /t:build
```

This will add your current directory as a volume to the container, set the working directory to the volume, and run the command `xbuild /t:clean` which will tell Mono to compile the project in the working directory and output the executable to `myapp`.
